				    A decision-support system for enhancing quality-associated decision-support processes by facilitating project 
				    quality performance forecasting, product quality performance measurement, product complexity analysis, operator 
				    quality performance assessment, and quality-induced rework man-hour estimation and control.<br/><br/>
				    Computer-based quality management systems have been widely implemented throughout the construction industry as 
				    per the requirement of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000. Although these systems have 
				    facilitated the collection of vast amounts of quality management data, conversion of this data into usable information 
				    remains challenging for many practitioners. Automated, data-driven quality management systems, which facilitate the 
				    transformation of data into usable information, are often implemented to enhance decision-making processes. However, 
				    for a data-driven quality management system to be successful, it must accurately estimate process uncertainty. 
				    Integration of accurate, reliable, and straightforward approaches that measure uncertainty of inspection processes are 
				    instrumental for the successful implementation of automated, data-driven quality management systems.<br/><br/>
				    This research has addressed these limitations by exploring and adapting Bayesian inference-based analytical solution 
				    and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based numerical solution for updating quality-associated decision-support systems 
				    in real-time. Using these accurate and reliable inputs, this research further develops novel, analytically-based 
				    approaches to improve the functionality of traditional pipe welding quality management systems.	<br/><br/>

				   In construction simulation, input models are typically represented as probabilistic distributions to account for the 
				    uncertain characteristics of construction operations. In todayâ€™s construction operations, various types of information 
				    are becoming available due to the implementation of advanced technologies (e.g., sensors and information systems) and 
				    these types of information have the potential to be dynamically incorporated for enhancing the reliability of input 
				    modeling.	<br/><br/>
				    The objective of this research is to enhance the state-of-the-art of simulation input modeling in a more dynamic, 
				    reliable, and informative manner through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In detail, this research 
				    enhances input modeling through incorporating multi-source data to derive up-to-date and detailed input models, 
				    thereby, augmenting the decision-making processes in construction operations.<br/><br/>

                <td style="width:50%;text-align:"><h4>Modeling Public Sentiment on Infrastructure Services in Disasters: Social Media Mining Approach</h4><br/>
				   
				    The objective of this research is to model the public sentiment on infrastructure services to provide a rapid and 
				    human-centered metric to relief agencies for distributing resources through mining social media data. <br/><br/>
				    Public sentiment, a direct indicator for representing public opinions and feelings, is an ideal candidate for providing 
				    consistent and human-centered insights on various infrastructure services to identify the most urgent ones for 
				    sustaining and saving human life. With advances in information technologies, social media is gaining increasing 
				    popularity for sharing opinions and feelings in disasters. Consequently, it becomes feasible and promising to model 
				    public sentiment in disasters through the collected opinions and feelings from social media due to their near real-time, 
				    social, and informative characteristics. Nevertheless, modeling of public sentiment is still limited due to the lack of 
				    systematic integration and development of infrastructure-specific algorithms.<br/><br/>
				    This research aims to address these limitations by building a systematic data-mining pipeline, as well as developing 
				    critical algorithms for modeling public sentiment on infrastructure services in disasters.
